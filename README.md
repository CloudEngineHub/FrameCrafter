## News

- **[2026-05]** Training code released. See [Training](#training) for the
  three-stage LoRA recipe used to produce the released checkpoint.
- **[2026-04]** Inference code released.

## Overview
We tackle the problem of sparse novel view synthesis (NVS) using video diffusion models: given *K* (≈ 5) multi-view images of a scene and their camera poses, we predict the view from a target camera pose. Many prior approaches leverage generative image priors encoded via diffusion models. However, models trained on single images lack multi-view knowledge. We instead argue that video models already contain implicit multi-view knowledge and so should be easier to adapt for NVS. Our key insight is to formulate sparse NVS as a low frame-rate video completion task. However, one challenge is that sparse NVS is defined over an unordered set of inputs, often too sparse to admit a meaningful order, so the models should be *invariant* to permutations of that input set. To this end, we present **FrameCrafter**, which adapts video models (naturally trained with coherent frame orderings) to permutation-invariant NVS through several architectural modifications, including per-frame latent encodings and removal of temporal positional embeddings. Our results suggest that video models can be easily trained to "forget" about time with minimal supervision, producing competitive performance on sparse-view NVS benchmarks.

## Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n framecrafter python=3.11 -y
conda activate framecrafter
pip install -e .
```

## Backbone Weights

The model requires pre-trained Wan2.1 backbone weights (DiT 14B, T5 text
encoder, VAE, CLIP image encoder). **By default these are downloaded
automatically on first run into `./models/`** — no setup needed.

**Choosing the download source.** Defaults to ModelScope. To download from
HuggingFace instead (often faster outside China):

```bash
export DIFFSYNTH_DOWNLOAD_SOURCE=huggingface
```

**Custom download location.** Override the default `./models/` directory:

```bash
export DIFFSYNTH_MODEL_BASE_PATH=/path/to/backbone/weights
```

Or pass it explicitly when loading the model:

```python
model = FrameCrafter(
    "ckpt/framecrafter.safetensors",
    base_model_dir="/path/to/backbone/weights",
)
```

## Model Weights

Download the FrameCrafter checkpoint into `ckpt/`:

**Option A -- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/szqwu/FrameCrafter) (recommended):**

```bash
huggingface-cli download szqwu/FrameCrafter framecrafter.safetensors --local-dir ckpt
```

**Option B -- Google Drive:**

```bash
bash prepare/download_ckpt.sh
```

Both place the checkpoint at `ckpt/framecrafter.safetensors` (the default path used by the scripts).

## Quick Start

### Demo

Run on bundled example scenes. Backbone weights
will be downloaded automatically to `./models/` on first run. The three examples
(`example1`, `example2`, `example3`) showcase different M-to-N configurations:
6-to-1, 6-to-2, and 3-to-1.

```bash
# Run first example scene
python demo.py

# Run a specific scene
python demo.py --scene example2

# Run all 3 example scenes
python demo.py --all
```

Generated frames are saved to `demo_output/<scene_name>/`. Use
`--output_dir <path>` to change the location.

### Python API

```python
from model import FrameCrafter
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# Load model (backbone weights auto-download to ./models/ on first run;
# pass base_model_dir=... to use a pre-downloaded location)
model = FrameCrafter("ckpt/framecrafter.safetensors")

# Prepare inputs -- M context images, M+N poses (M context + N target)
M = 6  # number of context views (flexible)
images = [Image.open(f"ctx_{i}.png") for i in range(M)]
data = np.load("scene.npz")
w2c_poses = data["w2c_poses"]    # (M+N, 4, 4) -- OpenCV w2c convention
intrinsics = data["intrinsics"]  # (M+N, 3, 3) -- at original image resolution

# Generate with automatic resize + center-crop
video = model.generate(
    images=images,
    w2c_poses=w2c_poses,
    intrinsics=intrinsics,
    height=480, width=832,
    resize_mode="crop",
)

# video[:M] are context frames, video[M:] are generated novel views
for i, novel_view in enumerate(video[M:]):
    novel_view.save(f"novel_view_{i}.png")
```

### CLI

```bash
python infer.py \
    --images ctx_0.png ctx_1.png ctx_2.png ctx_3.png ctx_4.png ctx_5.png \
    --poses_npz scene.npz \
    --height 480 --width 832 \
    --resize_mode crop \
    --output_dir results/
```

Add `--base_model_dir /path/to/backbone/weights` if you have the backbone
weights pre-downloaded somewhere other than `./models/`.

## Input Format

### Poses (.npz)

The `.npz` file should contain:

| Key | Shape | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| `w2c_poses` | (M+N, 4, 4) | World-to-camera extrinsics in OpenCV convention |
| `intrinsics` | (M+N, 3, 3) | Camera intrinsic matrices at original image resolution |

The first M entries correspond to the M context images (matching the
order of `--images`), and the remaining N entries are target camera
positions for novel view generation. Both M and N are flexible.

### Camera Conventions

All camera poses are **w2c (world-to-camera)** in **OpenCV convention**:
- x-right, y-down, z-forward

### Image Preprocessing

The model operates at a fixed resolution. Three modes are available:

1. **`resize_mode="crop"`** (recommended): Resize preserving aspect ratio,
   then center-crop to model resolution. Intrinsics are adjusted automatically.

2. **`resize_mode="stretch"`**: Plain resize ignoring aspect ratio.
   Intrinsics are adjusted automatically.

3. **`resize_mode=None`** (default): No preprocessing. Provide images and
   intrinsics already at model resolution.

Intrinsics are automatically scaled based on the input image dimensions.

## Tips

- **VRAM**: Set `--vram_limit` (in GB) to fit different GPUs. The model offloads weights to CPU when VRAM is limited. For example, use `--vram_limit 22` for a 24 GB card.
- **Speed**: Reduce `--num_inference_steps` to speed up generation (default 50; 10–20 still gives reasonable quality).

## Training

FrameCrafter is trained as a LoRA adapter (rank 32, `q,k,v,o,ffn.0,ffn.2`)
on top of the Wan2.1-I2V-14B backbone, with a small input-channel patch
that injects per-frame Plucker raymaps. The released checkpoint follows a
three-stage curriculum on [DL3DV-10K](https://github.com/DL3DV-10K/Dataset)
(960P, 1K-scene subset):

| Stage | Script | Resolution | Frames (M→N) | Epochs | Resume from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Low-res pretraining | `model_training/train_192_336_6to1.sh`  | 192×336 | 6 → 1 (fixed)         | 160 | — (from-scratch LoRA) |
| 2. Full-res 6-to-1     | `model_training/train_480_832_6to1.sh`  | 480×832 | 6 → 1 (fixed)         | 60  | stage 1 |
| 3. Full-res mixed M-to-N | `model_training/train_480_832_mixed.sh` | 480×832 | random M∈[3,9], N=10−M | 30  | stage 2 |

Stage 3 is what teaches the model to handle variable input/output view counts at
inference time. To resume across stages, uncomment the `--resume_checkpoint`
line at the bottom of the next stage's script.

### Dataset layout

Each scene must be a directory in DL3DV-10K-960P format:

```
<dataset_base_path>/
├── <scene_a>/
│   ├── images_4/             # RGB frames, sorted alphabetically
│   └── transforms.json       # nerfstudio-style intrinsics + per-frame
│                             # c2w transform_matrix (OpenGL convention)
└── <scene_b>/
    └── ...
```

By default the scripts point at `../DL3DV-10K_960P/1K` -- edit
`--dataset_base_path` / `--dataset_metadata_path` in each script to match
your layout.

### Hardware & multi-GPU

All three stages launch via `accelerate` over 8 processes (bf16). Stage 1
(192×336) fits on 8× 48 GB GPUs (e.g. A6000s) thanks to DeepSpeed
ZeRO-2, configured via the bundled `model_training/my_config.yaml`. The
480×832 stages (2 and 3) require 8× 80 GB GPUs (e.g. H100s)
and run with vanilla `accelerate launch` -- no ZeRO sharding needed.
Adjust `num_processes` in `my_config.yaml` (or via `accelerate config`)
to match your node, and tune `--gradient_accumulation_steps` to keep the
effective batch size constant on smaller setups. Wan2.1-I2V-14B backbone
weights download automatically to `./models/` on first run (see
[Backbone Weights](#backbone-weights) to relocate or switch source).
Logs stream to wandb under project `framecrafter`; export
`WANDB_MODE=offline` to disable network logging.

### Launching a stage

```bash
bash model_training/train_192_336_6to1.sh
# then, after stage 1 finishes:
bash model_training/train_480_832_6to1.sh
# then, after stage 2:
bash model_training/train_480_832_mixed.sh
```

LoRA checkpoints are written to `./models/train/framecrafter-<stage>/`.
The exported `.safetensors` files are drop-in compatible with the
`FrameCrafter(...)` loader used for inference.
